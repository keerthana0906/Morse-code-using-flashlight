# Morse-code-using-flashlight
This repository has two arduino code ,one to convert the entered text into morse code, the other to convert the morse code to normal english text

Text to morse  : In this the user has to enter an input statement in elglish ( alpha numeric ). The program will then convert this text to morse code and blink an LED connected on arduino to show the morse output

Morse to text : For acheiving this I have used photoresistor(LDR) to capture the morse code made using the flashlight or torch light. The arduino interprests this light as dot (.) or a dash(-)  based on the time it is blinking for.It then converts this series of dots and dashes into english text and dosplays on the monitor.
